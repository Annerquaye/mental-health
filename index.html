            <p><span class="myDropcap">R</span>emote learning, one of the unmistaken legacies of the pandemic, was
                intended to create a healthy way for
                students to continue to learn and connect with their teachers. For Jasmine, 16, taking remote classes
                was a
                matter of logging on to zoom and turning off her mic and camera.
            </p>
            <p>She took her lessons passively, resting her back against her bed’s headboard rather than at her study
                desk
                that
                came with an ergonomic chair. She felt comfortable. But in her comfort, she found taking lessons with
                undivided
                focus laborious.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine’s companion in those moments was her phone. She would occasionally text friends or check in on
                them
                on
                social media. Doing that allowed her to momentarily snap out of her boredom.
            </p>
            <p>But what started as her inability to remain attentive in class turned into an academic struggle as she
                fell
                farther and farther behind. The lessons became difficult to follow. She would often not turn in
                assignments.
                When she did, she missed deadlines.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine knew she was hurting deep inside. She knew she had the intellectual ability to do her school work
                but
                also knew that she was now way too far behind to catch up. She felt like she was drowning and wanted
                help
                just
                to stay afloat.
            </p>
            <p>In the past, when lessons became hard to follow, her peers came to her rescue before things could get out
                of
                hand. The virtual classes meant her support system was not readily available. That just added to her
                stress.
            </p>
            <p>The 16-year-old had grown completely disillusioned and no longer wanted anything to do with school. She
                said
                she
                was not suicidal. Yet, occasionally, she imagined what the world without her would be like.
            </p>
            <p>Despite her inner turmoil, she maintained a façade of smiles and laughter. Nevertheless, every single
                class
                piled
                on her worries. When she finally caught her parents’ attention, it wasn’t so much the plummeting grades
                (she
                never showed her parents) but her weight loss.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine has always been a picky eater as a child. When she turned 15, the 11th grader stood just under 5
                feet
                and
                barely 100 pounds, giving her a slender stature. She never noticed her unexpected weight loss as her
                diet
                remained relatively the same. Her mom has always lamented that she eats too little food for someone her
                age.
                Jasmine would often shrug off those concerns but this time, her parents, startled by the weight loss,
                wanted
                a
                solution. Her mother took her to her pediatrician. Jasmine had noticed the change in her looks, too.
                Some of
                her
                dresses did not fit as snugly as they used. They hung loosely.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine’s pediatrician had known her since she was a baby. After several visits, the doctor could not
                find
                anything medically wrong but prescribed vitamin supplements to increase her appetite. Her skinny
                physique
                was
                also beginning to weigh on her, especially as her doctor could not point out what was wrong. She thought
                a
                diagnosis would ease her rising anxiety and provide her with a route to recovery.
            </p>
            <p>The pediatrician checked in with Jasmine and her mother and was confident the vitamins would help her
                appetite.
                Jasmine wasn’t so sure. Still, she knew her parents were worried so figured she’d stick to them
                religiously.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine’s concerns about her health and academic issues had her mind racing in all directions. Her sleep
                was
                patchy. She yearned to understand what was happening to her body. She found no answers, only more
                worries
                which
                exacerbated her academic struggles.
            </p>
            <p>The eleventh grader found short-lived comfort whenever she talked to her doctor, but she yearned for a
                trained
                ear, a therapist to help her makes sense of all that’s happened and tell her she was doing fine. She
                knew
                her
                problems extended deeper than vitamins and food.
            </p>
            <p>One evening after her parents had finished dinner, she approached them. She told them she needed to speak
                to
                someone to help her with her emotional issues. Her parents were astounded. Sure, she wasn’t eating. And
                of
                course, she was bored with online school. Who wasn’t? But depressed? And needing a mental health expert?
                “They said, you can talk to us, and I was like ‘no!’, Jasmine recounts. “I would rather talk to an
                outside
                person.</p>
            <p>Her father, Robert, 45, is a leader in the local Presbyterian Church and insisted she open up to him
                instead.
                After all, they are her parents, and they have the right to know whatever struggles she might have.
                “They lack understanding, thinking that they are in a better position to handle my stress.”
            </p>
            <p>Her parents’ response to her therapist request confirmed her fears. She found her parents judgmental and
                believed
                only a professional therapist would understand her.
            </p>
            <p>“If you cannot talk to me about it,” she recollects her dad saying, “there are other people in the family
                you
                could talk to.” That response, she says, set back the trust in the relationship she shared with her dad.
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine’s parents, staunch Christians, migrated to the U.S. more than two decades ago from Ghana. Her
                father
                is a
                deacon in the Presbyterian Church of Ghana in Harlem, New York, with more than 200 congregants.
            </p>
            <p>As a deacon, Robert is a member of the committee that sees to the running of the church. He is one of the
                music
                directors in the church’s choir, a position which further made him one of the known faces within the
                congregation. Mavis Tetteh, Jasmine’s mother, plays an active role in church too, helping run the
                Women’s
                Fellowship, one of the groups geared for women above age 40.
            </p>
            <p>Even before the pandemic struck, concerns were mounting about a growing mental health crisis among Black
                people,
                especially their youth. Reports of depression, anxiety, and children attempting suicide were rampant.
                Then
                Covid-19 hit, intensifying fears that the infectious disease pandemic would ramp up the other, less
                easily
                noticeable, epidemic.</p>

            <p>Resolving the crisis would require a cocktail of solutions that extended beyond the
                individual patient. Experts pointed to the lack of access to mental health care, its skyrocketing costs,
                and
                the
                sheer isolation and systemic racism that too many young Black people feel. To tackle what many see as an
                impossible and complex issue, last February, the New York Senate established a task force to explore
                ways to
                improve mental health and prevent suicide in Black residents between the ages of 5 to 18 years.
            </p>
            <p>The task force was a response to mounting data. Experts found the virus disproportionately impacted Black
                people
                and increased pressure on legislators to act. One North Carolina study, for instance, found that while
                Black
                people made up about 20 percent of the population, they represented upwards of 35 percent of Covid cases
                there.
                Other studies echoed the findings. On top of the physical health crisis, the Black community was
                suffering
                emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>The senate’s task force was also influenced by a Centers for Disease Control study by researchers at New
                York
                University’s McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research.
                They gleaned results from a national school survey spanning 1991 to 2017 and found that while there has
                been
                an
                overall decline or no change at all among suicides, there was an increased rate of suicide attempts
                among
                black
                teens. Shockingly, black adolescents attempting to take their own lives rose by 73 percent.</p>
            <p>The study, which analyzed the behaviors of 200,0000 adolescents, also found something strange:
                Self-reported
                suicide ideation, a key risk factor in suicide, was declining, yet more people attempted suicide than
                before.
                This seeming paradox means that more people are good at masking their suicidal thoughts yet just as
                driven
                to
                harm themselves. Generally, suicide ideation provides early warning signals about suicide which may tell
                where
                prevention efforts are needed.
                However, the study showed that these signals were hidden, a situation that may thwart suicide prevention
                programs.</p>

            <p>New York University investigators, based on their findings, demanded a further probe into the rise in
                suicide
                and
                suicide attempts among Black adolescents.
                Time will tell whether the probe and task force is lip service or a step forward to save the children.
                The
                seven-member task force has a two-year mandate to explore ways to improve mental health and suicide
                prevention
                in a state where one in five African Americans is between ages 10 and 24, according to the latest
                American
                Community Survey (2016-2020) and CDC data (2010-2019) shows that suicide has remained a leading cause of
                deaths
                among adolescents.
            </p>

            <p>While there are several underlying factors behind rising suicide rates among Black youth, the stigma
                surrounding
                mental health and barriers Black people face in accessing treatment are commonly cited.
            </p>
            <div id='map'>
            </div>
            <p>However, an analysis of the locations of the New York State Office of Mental Health facilities providing
                services
                to adolescents shows that they are typically located within a 30-minute drive of where African Americans
                or
                Blacks live.

            <p>In fact, these facilities, which run various programs mental health programs, are within a
                30-minute drive of almost everyone, irrespective of race, throughout the state. This finding would
                perplex
                those
                who believe these facilities are often sited in locations that disadvantage specifically African
                Americans,
                This analysis arrived at this conclusion by mapping the physical locations of facilities in the state
                alongside
                the racial distribution of the population to determine whether it will take anyone driving from their
                home
                to
                the nearest facility more than 30 minutes.</p>

            <p>Some of these facilities also provide telehealth services which
                further enhance their reach. While this analysis showed an extensive geographic coverage of adolescent
                mental
                health services, determining whether these facilities are within a 15-minute drive would probably yield
                different results.
            </p>

            <p> That notwithstanding, there appears to be a disproportionate number of Black kids seeking treatment for
                several
                mental health illnesses, data from the New York State Office of Mental Health has shown. In 2019, census
                data
                revealed that one in five youth (under age 20) were African American. Yet, one-third of the state’s
                under 20
                population was Black youth using Medicaid to access intensive behavioral health services for children,
                meaning a
                more significant proportion of the Black kids' population is seeking mental health-related services.
            </p>
            <p>Comparatively, despite making up 70 percent of the state’s under-20 population, white kids made up 40
                percent
                of
                all kids who used Medicaid to access children's intensive behavioral services. Either they weren’t
                seeking
                help
                or had the money to pay for care.
            </p>
            <p>There are limits to the data: While there is a noticeable difference in the utilization of children's
                mental
                health care services by race, it is worth noting that the Office of Mental Health data did not
                distinguish
                between race and ethnicity. For instance, the census treats Hispanics as an ethnicity while the state
                mental
                health office treats it as a race.
            </p>

            <p>Mental health and adversity
            </p>
            <p>As attention turns to the unfolding mental health crisis among African American populations, researchers
                are
                keen
                to unravel the mystery. Finding a lasting solution to the Black mental health crisis would first require
                drilling into the factors at the heart of the issue.
            </p>
            <p>Myrna Weissman, who has spent the last 50 years teaching psychiatric epidemiology, which probes the
                causes
                and
                consequences of psychiatric disorders, said the spike in African American suicide could be explained by
                factors
                such as lack of trust in the health system as well as adversity.
                Since Black African Americans are disproportionately poor, they are mostly unable to afford mental
                healthcare,
                or it is not a priority. She also adds that because historically, Black patients believe they have not
                been
                treated fairly by the system, there is a lack of trust among black African Americans in the healthcare
                system.
            </p>
            <p>Two years ago, Nakiya Melanie, a 23-year-old African American living in Brooklyn who has often battled
                depression
                and anxiety, could not get out of bed. The previous night she had celebrated her birthday with friends
                at
                her
                home.
            </p>
            <p>It is almost routine for Melanie to have her friends come over for her birthday every year. It meant a
                lot to
                her. The seven days that followed her birthday night, she was stuck in bed with her depression and
                anxiety
                so
                intense like she had never experienced before.
                And when she decided with her boyfriend to seek medical help, the cost was one of the things they were
                very
                mindful of, in addition to getting a facility that was not too far from their home.
            </p>
            <p> “I didn't have any information on what this entails, and no one was giving me any insight,” Melanie
                recollects.
                “Even though I knew I needed help, I can't do that (sign up without considering the cost). The stress of
                that
                money will not help the situation either.”
            </p>
            <p>It took the couple nearly ten hours to find the ‘perfect’ facility at New York University. And when the
                two
                arrived at the hospital, Melanie was immediately rushed to the emergency ward of the psychiatric unit.
                Doctors
                diagnosed her with bipolar disorder. Dealing with severe depression and anxiety is not new to her, but
                what
                she
                dealt with after her birthday felt different.
                “People are likely to pay attention once you get suicidal,” says Melanie. “But the thing is, there’s
                always
                is a
                buildup to that part. Unless they educate themselves, people don't understand your actions when you have
                a
                mental illness.”</p>
            <p>Calibrating suicide detection tools</p>
            <p>Donna Barnes, who teaches at the Howard University Department of Psychiatry, argues that the instruments
                used
                in
                detecting suicide tendencies are not accurate in their prediction of suicide. “Many of the measurements
                or
                tools
                used do not work for us [African Americans] because there have not been enough studies [due to lack of
                funds] to
                prove our procedures are evidence-based,” she says.

            <p>Barnes believes that the National Institute of Mental Health, the federal agency that funds the bulk of
                research
                on mental disorders, would have to fund studies to help unravel the crisis unfolding.
                To do that, she suggested one of the means would be to commit funds to research into mental disorders
                being
                undertaken by Historically Black Colleges and Universities, also known as HBCUs.

            <p>In the last 30 years, only 20 of the listed 104HBCUs got funding to start their research. The bulk of the
                funding
                dollars, about 99 percent, have gone to traditional universities or institutions.
                Of course, it is possible that research into issues confronting the Black community, including mental
                health
                issues, are undertaken at other institutions. To fully flesh out these findings, further data into the
                kinds
                of
                studies, such as whether HBUC grants to study mental health, had been rejected.

            <p>That said, Barnes, teaches her students to always listen to their Black patients more, where
                possible,
                rather
                than rely solely on available literature to diagnose mental disorders.
                “I'm always telling my students that, when you have a 12-year-old Black male in front of
                you, and you
                are 30
                years and white, don't try to reference what they're saying because you can't. You have no
                references to
                what he
                is saying to you. You can't even relate, so you pull out your evidence-based tools for your
                white
                population,
                which doesn't work for them.”
            </p>
            <p>It is not strange to see Black kids expressing depression through anger, which Barnes says is
                not in sync
                with
                the 'dominant culture.' “Our evidence is different because there are certain risk factors
                and
                characteristics
                that we have that don’t match the dominant culture, and it’s not picked up,” she said.

            <em>Image: Rutgers University</em>
            <p>Research conducted at Rutgers University, New Jersey, five years ago demonstrates how
                symptoms of mental
                health
                illness among Blacks could be misdiagnosed. In 2018, researchers examining medical records
                of about
                1,700
                patients, of all ages, concluded African Americans with severe depression are more likely to
                be
                misdiagnosed
                with schizophrenia established than any other racial group.
            </p>
            <p>Even before Barnes, there have been concerns clinicians are prone to misdiagnosing certain
                mental health
                illnesses among Blacks mainly due to somewhat cultural differences in symptoms. That
                perception fired
                the
                curiosity of the Rutgers investigators. Their quest to find answers led them to probe
                whether clinicians
                accurately diagnosed about 600 Blacks and close to 1,100 with schizophrenia, a mental
                disorder
                characterized
                by
                hallucinations and delusions.
            </p>
            <p>The findings were resounding. The Rutgers researchers found ample evidence that clinicians
                failed to
                account
                for
                mood symptoms when diagnosing schizophrenia among Blacks, adding that ‘racial bias,’ whether
                conscious
                or
                subconscious, played a role in diagnosing schizophrenia in African Americans.
            </p>
            <p>“Why this phenomenon occurs remains unknown,” the authors said. “But it may represent either
                conscious or
                unconscious bias toward the meaning of psychiatric symptoms of African Americans or the
                effects on the
                clinical
                presentation of being a patient from a racial-ethnic minority group (for example, mistrust
                leading to
                less
                than
                full disclosure of presenting problems).”
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Dr. Lashonda Green, an African American psychologist, insists there’s a seeming
                lethargy
                among
                African Americans regarding mental health.
                “It's just that many Black people don't like to read [about mental health illness] and don't
                like to go
                to
                therapy,” she said. “A lot of black people don't like to volunteer to participate in
                psychological
                research
                or
                any other research.”
            </p>
            <p>In her opinion and direct contrast to Barnes, the survey instruments used in screening for
                mental health
                illnesses are pretty sound and scientific, backed by empirical research.
                “There's no perfect instrument,” Dr. Green said. “I think people are looking for specific
                instruments
                for
                all
                types of races. Everyone's looking for something specialized and unique. But what is
                available is
                heavily
                empirically supported, and it does apply to Black people, but they are not presenting
                themselves.”

            <p>More trust issues</p>

            <p>Two years ago, Helena Adu, 58, an African American Bronx resident, was unsettled by her
                21-year-old
                daughter's
                fixation with issues surrounding failed relationships.
            </p>
            <p>“Why do men cheat,” her daughter would often ask her, begging for answers. Adu’s sister was
                going through
                a
                divorce, making her think her daughter’s sudden curiosity about romantic relationships could
                be a
                result.
                But her daughter would not stop probing for answers on why such relationships break down.
            </p>

            <p>Adu, a registered
                nurse in the Bronx, knew something was amiss when her daughter complained of being ‘sick’
                and wanted to
                see
                a
                pastor rather than a physician.
                When she checked her daughter’s vital signs, everything seemed fine, but she still wanted to
                go to the
                hospital
                for an exhaustive assessment.
            </p>

            <p>In the routine assessment, her daughter insisted on being married with four kids. The issue
                is that Adu
                had
                lived
                with her daughter for the last ten years and was not aware of any marriage not to talk about
                having
                kids.
                And that was when Adu’s suspicions were confirmed. Her daughter was referred to the
                psychiatric unit of
                the
                BronxCare Hospital for further assessment.
            </p>
            <p>Later, Adu made another shocking discovery. Before her daughter's admission, she had texted
                several
                friends
                and
                relatives, accusing her immediate family of wanting to kill her.
                “Indeed, I didn’t know about those messages,” said Adu. “Those who received them were
                alarmed, but as a
                matter
                of fact, I did not want to see those messages. I didn’t want to be stressed by the content
                of these
                messages.”
            </p>

            <p>Adu’s daughter had a long-distance romantic relationship with a boy from Ghana. The two had
                not seen each
                other
                in nearly ten years when her daughter left Ghana to reunite with her.
                The relationship blossomed until her daughter started receiving reports of her boyfriend’s
                infidelity.
                “She
                didn’t quite believe. But the evidence from her cousins would not stop coming,” said Adu.
                “It seems like
                she
                snapped when she could not bear it any longer.”
            </p>
            <p>Her daughter was admitted and later diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication,
                although she
                would
                later disagree with the diagnosis. A few weeks into her medication after her discharge,
                Adu’s daughter
                was
                also
                diagnosed with Schatzki’s ring, a medical condition that narrows the esophagus and makes it
                difficult to
                swallow.
                It took a minor surgical procedure, balloon dilation, to correct the condition, which Adu
                strongly
                believes
                was
                a side effect of her daughter’s medication, Abilify, although that was never confirmed.
                Subsequently,
                her
                doctors recommended a lower dosage and eventually took her off the drug.
            </p>
            <p>Despite improvement in her daughter’s condition, there’s a part of Adu that still holds the
                view that her
                daughter was misdiagnosed. Though she concedes she’s not in a position to clinically
                diagnosed her
                daughter,
                she
                firmly believes the slew of questions asked her before making their decision were “all over
                the place”
                and
                could
                not have provided enough justification for a bipolar disorder diagnosis.
                “Sometimes, I believe they just needed to diagnose my daughter so they can just put her on a
                medication,”
                said
                Adu. “Perhaps, she was just depressed.”
            </p>
            <p>While Adu may not have any evidence about the misdiagnosis, Barnes believes they are not out
                of place.
                She
                also
                accuses doctors treating mental health illnesses of being quick to prescribe medications,
                which may not
                always
                be the solution.
                “The first thing they pull out is a medication that doesn’t always work,” she said. “Many
                people take
                their
                own
                lives and don't have a mental disorder. They took their own life because life is not worth
                living to
                them,”
                Barnes says.
                Sometimes people suffering from certain mental illnesses need someone to talk to and confide
                in, “and
                that’s
                all
                it takes.”
            </p>
            <p>Looking forward
            </p>
            <p>The church plays a vital role in the culture of African Americans, with nearly 8 in 10 people
                identifying
                as
                Christians.
            </p>
            <p>About 20 years ago, a parishioner at a local church, Healing Center in Tennessee, who had
                previously
                sought
                counseling for an unstated mental illness, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the
                church.
                While the act left parishioners traumatized, William Young, an African American priest, then
                a chaplain
                at
                another local church, said the incident exposed why the church must drive mental health
                awareness and
                suicide
                prevention in Black communities.

            <p>Bishop Young’s persistence led to the inaugural National Suicide and the Black Church
                Conference -- an
                event
                that
                addresses the root causes behind hopelessness that can lead to suicide, particularly in the
                African
                American
                community -- hosted by the Healing Center and is held every other year.
                “There was a myth that Black people didn’t commit suicide, only white people,” Bishop Young
                said.
                “The myth also says we're stronger because we had come through slavery, but the reality was
                that many
                people
                had
                died from suicide because suicide is the result of extreme depression.”
            </p>

            <p>For Dr. Lashonda Green, who currently consults as a clinical psychologist in New Jersey,
                faith-based
                groups
                could
                be instrumental in promoting mental health awareness and suicide prevention among African
                Americans. She
                said
                that training critical people in the church on counseling is a good starting point.
                “I don't think they've done a good job training their people. When you're feeling down and
                discouraged,
                it's
                one
                thing to have to speak to a deacon or a church elder,” she said.
                “But when dealing with mass shootings, divorce, and gender issues, you need to seek help
                outside the
                church
                and
                speak with somebody who is more objective and professionally trained. I don't think the
                church has done
                enough
                to encourage its people to do that.”
            </p>

            <p>When Jasmine didn’t get her father’s approval to seek professional therapy, she turned to Rex
                Agyemang,
                32,
                her
                youth leader in the church. Although not a clinical psychologist or a trained counselor, Rex
                had some
                psychology
                knowledge from his undergraduate courses.
                As a leader in the youth department of Jasmine’s church, his responsibilities include
                providing a form
                of
                spiritual counseling in line with Christian principles. Despite performing in this role for
                more than
                five
                years, he believes people like him who interface with the youth need training in guidance
                counseling,
                among
                others.
                “One of the reasons I can assist people like Jasmine is because of traits that I have, my
                knack for
                wanting
                to
                help people,” said Rex. “But as far I’m concerned, sharpening this skillset through guidance
                counseling
                training
                would be useful in helping more people.”
            </p>
            <p>For faith-based institutions like churches to help resolve the Black youth mental crisis the
                country
                faces,
                they
                must learn to communicate in the language that the youth can relate to – not just a
                top-bottom approach,
                said
                Olusola Adegbite, a Ph.D. candidate at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>degbite, a youth leader at a local church she asked not to be named because she is not an
                authorized
                spokesperson, argued that churches that do not factor in the needs of the youth in their
                activities are
                bound to
                achieve less meaningful results.
                “We think we know what we should be doing for the people, and we just like expect them to
                show up and
                participate because we are doing a lot of work making happen for them,” Adegbite said.
                “It's supposed to be the other way around. We need to listen to the people first and
                determine their
                greatest
                needs. We need to find out some ways that they are already handling whatever issues they
                have and find
                ways
                to
                enhance it.”
            </p>
            <p>Adegbite also added that the manner of education needed for church members to openly
                acknowledge the
                realness
                of
                issues surrounding mental and suicide must be openly led from the pulpit.
                “Talking about it [mental health and related issues] from the pulpit is an important aspect
                of
                validating
                people's experiences because other things that we don't talk about in church, people don't
                feel
                comfortable
                to
                talk about them either,” said Adegbite.

            <p>Lydia Torgbor, who has been with the Presbyterian Church in Harlem since it was established
                in the
                mid-80s,
                argues that many faith-based institutions can do to demystify mental health and suicide
                prevention.
            </p>

            <p>Torgbor, who racked three decades of experience teaching kids in public schools, was in
                charge of the
                church’s
                youth wing throughout her career, providing guidance counseling to hundreds of kids. She
                provided a
                listening
                ear and acted as a confidante for kids through her teaching.
                “Our church, like any other, provides that spiritual guidance to our members. We have not
                necessarily
                been
                deliberate about mental health awareness and suicide prevention,” said Torgbor. “But I
                concede the
                church
                can do
                a much better job in creating awareness and letting its members know that it is alright to
                seek care
                elsewhere
                when for instance, you are severely depressed. ”One of the church kids Torgbor raised is
                Rex, Jasmine’s
                youth
                leader. </p>

            <p>The retired teacher states that given the conversation about the growing mental crisis
                surrounding Black
                youth, she would discuss the issue with the church’s leadership, discussing what mitigating
                role the
                church
                can
                play for its youth.
                “One of the avenues we would explore is training these youth leaders to recognize some of
                these common
                mental
                issues that these kids face,” Torgbor said. “These leaders spend a lot of time with these
                kids, and
                giving
                them
                that training would help immensely to help identify distressed kids.”
            </p>
            <p>Stigma in the home
            </p>
            <p>Jasmine’s parents are instrumental in a community where mental health awareness and suicide
                prevention
                are
                not
                openly discussed as experts say they should be. Aside from the stigma in the church, there
                could be
                other
                reasons for not giving in to their daughter’s request for therapy.
            </p>
            <p>There’s a misconception among African American parents that something goes wrong with their
                kids reflects
                poorly
                on them, said Dr. Barnes. “They (parents) hide and don't want to talk about it,” she said.
                “They want to think that if they avoid the situation, it will go away; instead, if you avoid
                the
                problem, it
                worsens. While parents and families mean well, they can often hinder the tender issues of
                mental health
                and
                suicide.”
            </p>
            <p>Robert, Jasmine’s father, recounts vividly when her daughter approached him seeking to talk
                to a
                therapist.
                He
                sees no reason why her daughter should not be able to open up to him or any family member as
                he had
                suggested.
                “As a parent, I felt it was right to know at least what she’s going through. At least
                knowing that would
                help me
                guide her on what to do,” Robert said. “After all, if the situation is beyond me, we can
                always seek
                help
                externally. But I still believe as her father; she should be able to open up to me first.”
                In Robert’s vague recollection of events, Jasmine’s mother supposedly took her to a
                therapist. Indeed,
                Jasmine
                never saw any therapist apart from seeking guidance from one of the youth leaders in the
                church, and her
                dad
                conceded that he never followed up on the issue again.

            <p>But Kim Kaiser, the Director of Diversity Equity and Inclusion at Families Together in New
                York State, a
                non-profit that advocates mental health needs of children, thinks that stigma exists among
                African
                American
                families and churches because people are trained to focus on their strengths and suppress
                their
                weaknesses.</p>
            <p>“Suicide is rising exponentially amongst our Black youth, and we know we have got to work
                first on the
                stigma,” Kaiser said. “It's like decolonizing mental health therapy in your head to
                understand that this
                is bigger
                than just a fractured system. It is about getting your child the help that they need.”

                believes that family, as the basic unit of society, has an integral role to play.
